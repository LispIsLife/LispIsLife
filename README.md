- ðŸ‘‹ Hello fellow Lisper, join me on my journey to tame chaos with the power of the parens!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in automating brain damaging day-to-day tasks (starting with Excel for now) with intuitive and simple code.
- ðŸŒ± I am learning Common Lisp for about a year, because this language allows me to program towards the API of my choice with maximal speed and interactivity.
