- ðŸ‘‹ Hello traveler, welcome to the land of peace and parens.
- ðŸŒ± I am learning Common Lisp (CL) for about a year, because this language allows me to program towards the API of my choice with maximal speed and interactivity.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in automating brain damaging day-to-day tasks with intuitive and simple code. For now, I would like to minimize the impedance mismatch between Excel and other datasources by providing an easy interface to Excel in CL code. Once Excel data is easily accessible in CL, it should be straightforward to write all kind of utilities to connect Excel datasources
